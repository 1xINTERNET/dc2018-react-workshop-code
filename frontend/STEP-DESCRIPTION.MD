# Step 5

- Create two components:

  - `./src/ArticleDetail` (receives the node ID of the article as a prop)
  - `./src/ArticleList`

- Install the `prop-types` module which we use to enable prop type validation on the `<ArticleDetail />` component.

- Include both new components in the `<App />` component. (At this point we just pass a static node ID to the `<ArticleDetail />`)
