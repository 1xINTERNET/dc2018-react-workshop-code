# Step 1

In this step we will just remove some things generate by `create-react-app` so we have a better overview in step 2.

- Files that we will delete for now, because they are outside of the scope of this workshop:
  - `./src/App.css`
  - `./src/logo.svg`
  - `./src/App.test.js`
- Also just ignore `./src/registerServerWorker.js` for now. (you can [read about it in the CRA docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#making-a-progressive-web-app))
